 Explain generally what is meant by a NoSQL database

A NoSQL databse is a mechanism to store and retrieve data (much like any database). What makes NoSQL databases unique compared
to SQL databases or other databases in general is that it is created to support agility. It is built to support large amounts of
new and changeing data. NoSQL databases have many different types of data in them unlike a classic SQL database, NoSQL adapts to 
cahnge in terms of it expanding horizontally, meaning that if you were to add more servers to your database then NoSQL would 
accomodate the new server and spread the data to best fit the new setup. Unlike SQL in which you would have to add onto the current
server rather than being able to add new ones in; as the data does not accomodate new servers. NoSQL does not have to store data in
tables. NoSql sacrificies some harddrive space for flexibility. 

Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional
relational SQL Database like MySQL.


Explain how databases like MongoDB and redis would be classified in the NoSQL world

MongoDB would be classified as a document NoSQL database. 

Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB

Explain, using relevant examples, the strategy for querying MongoDB (all CRUD operations)

Demonstrate, using a REST-API, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB

Explain the benefits from using Mongoose, and provide an example involving all CRUD operations

Explain how redis "fits" into the NoSQL world, and provide an example of how to use it.

Explain, using a relevant example, how redis (or a similar) can increase scalability (drastic) for a server using
server side sessions

Explain, using a relevant example, a full MEAN application including relevant test cases to test the REST-API
(not on the production database)
